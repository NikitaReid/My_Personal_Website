title: Which code was cooler
---



<div id="polling-which-code-sounded-cooler" class="section level1">
<h1>Polling which code sounded cooler</h1>
<p>I went around to a sample of 100 people whom I am acquainted with in some way or another and asked them to look at my Python and R tiles and decide which code/application was their favourite. I recorded the data in excel (we all make mistakes), and will now analyze it here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># read in the data
poll &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;poll.csv&quot;))

# count number of favourites for each code and plot bar graph 
poll %&gt;% 
  count(Favourite) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Favourite, y = n, fill=Favourite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +

# some labels 
  labs(title = &quot;Which programming language won?&quot;,
       x = &quot;Favourite Code&quot;, y = &quot;Number of people&quot;) +
  guides(fill=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog6_files/figure-html/poll_data-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There is a clear favourite here…</p>
<p>However, as a student of the scientific and rigorous persuasion, it is my duty to ascertain whether people in fact understood the choice they were making. I asked the same 100 people whether they understood the Python code and the concept of what it was supposed to do.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># count number of favourites and understanding
# for each code and plot grouped bar graph 
poll %&gt;% 
  group_by(Favourite, Understood_Python) %&gt;% 
  count() %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Favourite, y = n, fill=Understood_Python)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) +

# some labels 
  labs(title = &quot;Which programming language won?&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;and did people actually understand what they were voting for?&quot;,
       x = &quot;Favourite Code&quot;, y = &quot;Number of people&quot;, 
       fill=&quot;Understood the \nPython application?&quot;) </code></pre>

<p>Python can do some cool things, and I will stick to that! However, this survey was clearly not the most reliable as most people did not know what was going on. And yes, multiple individuals surveyed did ask me if I could use Astrophysics to predict their star sign…</p>
