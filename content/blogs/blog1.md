The journey starts with four years of horrible Mathematics with some super cool
space exploration in between. I created the above picture at the UCL Observatory 
sometime in the Spring of 2019, using two different Celestron-14 telescopes, nine 
different colour filters and about three hours of observing time. Some fancy computer 
and Photoshop antics later and we have a lovely galaxy image like the ones you see on Google.
This is known as the "Pinwheel Galaxy". Can you see why?
