title: Which code was cooler
---



<div id="polling-which-code-sounded-cooler" class="section level1">
<h1>Polling which code sounded cooler</h1>
<p>I went around to a sample of 100 people whom I am acquainted with in some way or another and asked them to look at my Python and R tiles and decide which code/application was their favourite. I recorded the data in excel (we all make mistakes), and will now analyze it here.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># read in the data
poll &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;poll.csv&quot;))

# count number of favourites for each code and plot bar graph 
poll %&gt;% 
  count(Favourite) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Favourite, y = n, fill=Favourite)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +

# some labels 
  labs(title = &quot;Which programming language won?&quot;,
       x = &quot;Favourite Code&quot;, y = &quot;Number of people&quot;) +
  guides(fill=&quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog6_files/figure-html/poll_data-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>There is a clear favourite hereâ€¦</p>
<p>However, as a student of the scientific and rigorous persuasion, it is my duty to ascertain whether people in fact understood the choice they were making. I asked the same 100 people whether they in fact understood the Python code and the concept of what it was supposed to do.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># count number of favourites for each code and plot bar graph 
poll %&gt;% 
  group_by(Favourite,Understood_Python) %&gt;% 
  count() %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Favourite, y = n, fill=Understood_Python)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) +

# some labels 
  labs(title = &quot;Which programming language won?&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;and did people actually understand what they were voting for?&quot;,
       x = &quot;Favourite Code&quot;, y = &quot;Number of people&quot;, 
       fill=&quot;Understood the \nPython application?&quot;) </code></pre>
