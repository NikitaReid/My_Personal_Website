title: Python helps us figure out...
---

Using the incomparable MPDAF package in Python, we can load in spectroscopic data
(a fancy type of data that looks at the absorption and emission of different 
frequencies of light). We then isolate particular emission bits or "lines" that 
we expect to associate with large objects from the early times of the Universe 
and we measure the strength and about a hundred other parameters of these lines. 
Then we do some beautiful mathematics and figure out what "stuff" produced enough 
light to create the Universe we know today and how long ago it happened. This is
the gist of the science of Cosmology - the study of the earliest epochs of the 
Universe. I will not dare subject readers to the python code behind this 
nor the "long" explanation of how we do this. Above you can see one such "spectrum"
for one of these big objects as well as some important "lines" we identified and 
measured and one or two typical collections of data we record. Enjoy! You can't 
do this stuff in R ...
